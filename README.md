========

Flexlay is a generic 2d editor with special focus on games. It
currently supports multi layered tile-, object- and bitmaps, full
undo/redo, support for tile-brushes, easy copy/paste, multiple
buffers, minimap support, a metadata editor and some other stuff
usefull for creating levels for 2d games.

Supported games are at the moment:

 netPanzer  - http://netpanzer.berlios.de/
 SuperTux   - http://super-tux.sourceforge.net/
 
Flexlay can't be run on its own, but instead of you have to start it 
via wrapper scripts (supertux-editor, windstille-editor,
netpanzer-editor).

To run the SuperTux version of Flexlay, see [the wiki](https://github.com/SuperTux/flexlay/wiki/Downloading-and-Running-the-Flexlay-Editor)

copyright headers in place and distribute the source too if you
distribute binaries, see the file COPYING for details.
